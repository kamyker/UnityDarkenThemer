# UnityDarkenThemer

Last working Unity version: 2019.3.3, doesn't work in 2019.3.10 :(

Code is a bit of a mess, decided not to clean it up as it stopped working anyway.

Usage:
- Create UnityDarkenSettings scriptable object, click all buttons from top to bottom without last one (Undarken all)
- After next Unity restart just click Tools -> Quick Fix
